According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The sources added that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in Washington to help examine allegations of Russian interference in the vote. One of the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks. Russia has loomed large over the first six months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt the presidential election in Trump\\u2019s favor. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is leading the probe, which also examines potential collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts.   At a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday night, Trump said: \\u201cMost people know there were no Russians in our campaign. ... We didn\\u2019t win because of Russia. We won because of you.\\u201d Mueller\\u2019s use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence, including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled.  A spokesman for Mueller declined comment. A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who, working behind closed doors, considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought. \\u201cThis is a serious development in the Mueller investigation,\\u201d said Paul Callan, a former prosecutor.  \\u201cGiven that Mueller inherited an investigation that began months ago, it would suggest that he has uncovered information pointing in the direction of criminal charges. But against whom is the real question.\\u201d  A lawyer for Trump, Jay Sekulow, appeared to downplay the significance of a grand jury, telling Fox News: \\u201cThis is not an unusual move.\\u201d U.S. stocks and the dollar weakened following the news, while U.S. Treasury securities gained. It was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate.  Some lawyers said it would put pressure on potential witnesses to cooperate with Mueller\\u2019s investigation.  \\u201cWhen someone gets a subpoena to testify, that can drive home the seriousness of the investigation,\\u201d said David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former federal prosecutor.  In 2005, a grand jury convened by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald returned an indictment of Lewis \\u201cScooter\\u201d Libby, a top aide to then-Vice President Dick Cheney. \\u201cA special counsel can bring an indictment and it has happened before,\\u201d said Renato Mariotti, a partner at the law firm Thompson Coburn and a former federal prosecutor. News last month of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about his father\\u2019s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaign\\u2019s dealings with Moscow.  The Republican president has defended his son\\u2019s behavior, saying many people would have taken that meeting. Trump\\u2019s son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. One of the sources said major Russian efforts to interfere in the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf began shortly after the June meeting, making it a focus of Mueller\\u2019s investigation. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he was not aware that Mueller had started using a new grand jury. \\u201cGrand jury matters are typically secret,\\u201d Cobb said. \\u201cThe White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\\u201d John Dowd, one of Trump\\u2019s personal lawyers, said: \\u201cWith respect to the news of the grand jury, I can tell you President Trump is not under investigation.\\u201d A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.  Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has questioned Mueller\\u2019s impartiality and members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that Trump might dismiss him. Republican and Democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to block Trump from firing Mueller.  Sekulow denied that was Trump\\u2019s plan. \\u201cThe president is not thinking of firing Bob Mueller,\\u201d Sekulow said. One source briefed on the matter said Mueller was investigating whether, either at the meeting or afterward, anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material they had been collecting on the Clinton campaign since March 2016. Another source familiar with the inquiry said that while the president himself was not now under investigation, Mueller\\u2019s investigation was seeking to determine whether he knew of the June 9 meeting in advance or was briefed on it afterward. Reuters earlier reported that Mueller\\u2019s team was examining money-laundering accusations against Manafort and hoped to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russia. It is not known if the grand jury is investigating those potential charges. \",\n          \"Sarah Sanders announced during the White House press briefing Tuesday that President Trump would visit Mississippi this weekend. On his trip, Trump will participate in the grand opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. Sanders was asked later in the briefing if Trump s visit to the civil rights museum was a good idea. American Urban Radio reporter April Ryan asked about various members of the NAACP and black ministers who are protesting the visit. .@PressSec on @POTUS's statement regarding Charlottesville violence in August: \\\"I think @POTUS got his statement very clear when he condemned all forms of racism, bigotry, and violence.

What say you?  Ryan asked.Sanders called the planned protests to Trump s visit  sad,  saying:I think that would be honestly very sad. I think this is something that should bring the country together, to celebrate the opening of this museum and highlighting civil rights movement and the progress that we ve made and I would hope those individuals join in instead of protesting. Ryan continued her questioning, asking if Trump s statement on the riots in Charlottesville would be seen as an  insult  to those in attendance. Ryan said  They take it as an insult that he s coming. As we ve had issues of Charlottesville. The president didn t get his statement straight on Charlottesville Sanders cut Ryan off, slamming the door on the line of questioning:I think he s statement was very clear. He made it very clear. He s against violence and bigotry.After the riots in Charlottesville, Trump said:We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.VIA: DAILY CALLER \",\n          \"MIDDELBURG, South Africa (Reuters) - Two white South African farmers who were filmed pushed a wailing black man into a coffin were sentenced to jail on Friday for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping. The 20-second video, widely circulated on social media last year, shows the victim, Victor Mlotshwa, cowering inside a coffin as one man pushes the lid down and the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside. The defendants - Theo Jackson, sentenced to 14 years, and Willem Oosthuizen, sentenced to 11 years - had pleaded not guilty. They said they had caught Mlotshwa trespassing on their farm in possession of stolen copper cables. The case, heard at a court in Middelburg, about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Pretoria, has caused outrage in a country where deep racial divides persist 23 years after the end of apartheid. When she handed down the sentences, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said she was appalled that the accused had put Mlotshwa into a coffin.  The evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighs the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders,  she said.  The conduct of the accused fueled social division and racial tension.      The defense immediately requested that it be allowed to appeal the sentence, but Mphahlele dismissed their application. The defense then said it would lodge their appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal, saying that the sentence was too harsh, since no one had been killed. South Africa s Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the sentence could serve as a deterrent to others.  South Africa is no longer prepared to treat racism with kid gloves and we are ready to act,  Justice Minister Michael Masutha said in an interview with eNCA. A large crowd formed outside the packed courtroom. The police presence around the court was heavy.  What they did was painful to us,  Qgoga Mnyamezeli said outside the court. Hundreds of members of the country s main political parties, including the ruling African National Congress and the main opposition Democratic Alliance party, gathered outside carrying placards, some which said  Black Lives Matter! , and shouting slogans in support of Mlotshwa. Black people make up 80 percent of South Africa s 54 million population, but most its wealth remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"left-news\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mar 11, 2017\",\n          \"September 8, 2017 \",\n          \"May 11, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The sources added that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in Washington to help examine allegations of Russian interference in the vote. One of the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks. Russia has loomed large over the first six months of the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia worked to tilt the presidential election in Trump\\u2019s favor. Mueller, who was appointed special counsel in May, is leading the probe, which also examines potential collusion by the Trump campaign with Russia. Moscow denies any meddling and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts.   At a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday night, Trump said: \\u201cMost people know there were no Russians in our campaign. ... We didn\\u2019t win because of Russia. We won because of you.\\u201d Mueller\\u2019s use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence, including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled.  A spokesman for Mueller declined comment. A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who, working behind closed doors, considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought. \\u201cThis is a serious development in the Mueller investigation,\\u201d said Paul Callan, a former prosecutor.  \\u201cGiven that Mueller inherited an investigation that began months ago, it would suggest that he has uncovered information pointing in the direction of criminal charges. But against whom is the real question.\\u201d  A lawyer for Trump, Jay Sekulow, appeared to downplay the significance of a grand jury, telling Fox News: \\u201cThis is not an unusual move.\\u201d U.S. stocks and the dollar weakened following the news, while U.S. Treasury securities gained. It was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate.  Some lawyers said it would put pressure on potential witnesses to cooperate with Mueller\\u2019s investigation.  \\u201cWhen someone gets a subpoena to testify, that can drive home the seriousness of the investigation,\\u201d said David Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School and a former federal prosecutor.  In 2005, a grand jury convened by Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald returned an indictment of Lewis \\u201cScooter\\u201d Libby, a top aide to then-Vice President Dick Cheney. \\u201cA special counsel can bring an indictment and it has happened before,\\u201d said Renato Mariotti, a partner at the law firm Thompson Coburn and a former federal prosecutor. News last month of the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about his father\\u2019s presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, fueled questions about the campaign\\u2019s dealings with Moscow.  The Republican president has defended his son\\u2019s behavior, saying many people would have taken that meeting. Trump\\u2019s son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. One of the sources said major Russian efforts to interfere in the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf began shortly after the June meeting, making it a focus of Mueller\\u2019s investigation. Ty Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he was not aware that Mueller had started using a new grand jury. \\u201cGrand jury matters are typically secret,\\u201d Cobb said. \\u201cThe White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\\u201d John Dowd, one of Trump\\u2019s personal lawyers, said: \\u201cWith respect to the news of the grand jury, I can tell you President Trump is not under investigation.\\u201d A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment.  Lawyers for Trump Jr. and Kushner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump has questioned Mueller\\u2019s impartiality and members of Congress from both parties have expressed concern that Trump might dismiss him. Republican and Democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to block Trump from firing Mueller.  Sekulow denied that was Trump\\u2019s plan. \\u201cThe president is not thinking of firing Bob Mueller,\\u201d Sekulow said. One source briefed on the matter said Mueller was investigating whether, either at the meeting or afterward, anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign encouraged the Russians to start releasing material they had been collecting on the Clinton campaign since March 2016. Another source familiar with the inquiry said that while the president himself was not now under investigation, Mueller\\u2019s investigation was seeking to determine whether he knew of the June 9 meeting in advance or was briefed on it afterward. Reuters earlier reported that Mueller\\u2019s team was examining money-laundering accusations against Manafort and hoped to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russia. It is not known if the grand jury is investigating those potential charges. \",\n          \"Sarah Sanders announced during the White House press briefing Tuesday that President Trump would visit Mississippi this weekend. On his trip, Trump will participate in the grand opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. Sanders was asked later in the briefing if Trump s visit to the civil rights museum was a good idea. American Urban Radio reporter April Ryan asked about various members of the NAACP and black ministers who are protesting the visit. .@PressSec on @POTUS's statement regarding Charlottesville violence in August: \\\"I think @POTUS got his statement very clear when he condemned all forms of racism, bigotry, and violence. There's no gray area there \\\" pic.twitter.com/1OCs4W48Pq  Fox News (@FoxNews) December 5, 2017 There are comments from people from the NAACP from black ministers who are planning on protesting and boycotting this weekend for the president s visit to the Civil Rights Museum. What say you?  Ryan asked.Sanders called the planned protests to Trump s visit  sad,  saying:I think that would be honestly very sad. I think this is something that should bring the country together, to celebrate the opening of this museum and highlighting civil rights movement and the progress that we ve made and I would hope those individuals join in instead of protesting. Ryan continued her questioning, asking if Trump s statement on the riots in Charlottesville would be seen as an  insult  to those in attendance. Ryan said  They take it as an insult that he s coming. As we ve had issues of Charlottesville. The president didn t get his statement straight on Charlottesville Sanders cut Ryan off, slamming the door on the line of questioning:I think he s statement was very clear. He made it very clear. He s against violence and bigotry.After the riots in Charlottesville, Trump said:We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.VIA: DAILY CALLER \",\n          \"MIDDELBURG, South Africa (Reuters) - Two white South African farmers who were filmed pushed a wailing black man into a coffin were sentenced to jail on Friday for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping. The 20-second video, widely circulated on social media last year, shows the victim, Victor Mlotshwa, cowering inside a coffin as one man pushes the lid down and the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside. The defendants - Theo Jackson, sentenced to 14 years, and Willem Oosthuizen, sentenced to 11 years - had pleaded not guilty. They said they had caught Mlotshwa trespassing on their farm in possession of stolen copper cables. The case, heard at a court in Middelburg, about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, Pretoria, has caused outrage in a country where deep racial divides persist 23 years after the end of apartheid. When she handed down the sentences, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said she was appalled that the accused had put Mlotshwa into a coffin.  The evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighs the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders,  she said.  The conduct of the accused fueled social division and racial tension.      The defense immediately requested that it be allowed to appeal the sentence, but Mphahlele dismissed their application. The defense then said it would lodge their appeal directly to the Supreme Court of Appeal, saying that the sentence was too harsh, since no one had been killed. South Africa s Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the sentence could serve as a deterrent to others.  South Africa is no longer prepared to treat racism with kid gloves and we are ready to act,  Justice Minister Michael Masutha said in an interview with eNCA. A large crowd formed outside the packed courtroom. The police presence around the court was heavy.  What they did was painful to us,  Qgoga Mnyamezeli said outside the court. Hundreds of members of the country s main political parties, including the ruling African National Congress and the main opposition Democratic Alliance party, gathered outside carrying placards, some which said  Black Lives Matter! , and shouting slogans in support of Mlotshwa. Black people make up 80 percent of South Africa s 54 million population, but most its wealth remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Assange got married when he was 18 and has a son. He and his wife separated and in 1999, after a protracted court battle, he reached a custody agreement with his wife.Assange gained worldwide fame and became a household name after he released hacked DNC emails shining a light on the ugly and questionable inner workings of Hillary, her campaign and many in the Democratic Party.Assange, who has been living in the embassy for four years after he was granted political asylum by Ecuador, came under fire this week after a 8,000-plus-file dump of CIA secrets was posted on WikiLeaks.Vice President Pence Thursday vowed to go after the web site, saying the leak was  one of the most significant compromises of national security in recent memory. Apparently Baywatch  star Pamela Anderson has a  thing  for  the world s most famous leaker, Julian Assange. Anderson s gone from slow motion runs on the beach to mysterious late night visits to the embassy where WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is holed up.Anderson was most recently spotted entering the Ecuadorian safe space in London Thursday night wearing a camel overcoat, snug black top   and either a really short skirt, or no pants at all.Anderson, 49, is a regular at the facility, coyly smiling for photographers as she struts inside to see Assange, 45, whose rogue outfit has dumped some of the US government s most closely guarded secrets.She refused to deny the dating rumors   saying he intellectually stimulates her more than all her  ex-husbands and lovers combined. I think he s quite sexy,  she wrote in a blog post on Thursday.  He has tremendous strength and stamina   though vulnerable. Hard to imagine him that way   as capable as he is. But, he is up against the biggest super powers in the world. Speaking to John Bishop on The Nightly Show this week, she described meeting Assange last year through British fashion designer Vivienne Westwood. We started seeing each other every month, and now we see each other a lot more regularly,  she said, according to The Sun. I do really think he s one of the most important people in the world, and I think what he does is historic. It s very important,  Anderson added.  He s very brave and he sacrificed a lot for all of us.

Specter s amendment would have stricken the provision regarding habeas review. The underlying bill would have authorized a trial by military commission for violations of the law of war. Here is what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say about the bill from the Senate floor:Senator Graham asked,  Do we really want enemy prisoners to bring every lawsuit known to man against the people fighting the war and protecting us? No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf. No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military. That does not make us safer.  Senator Arlon Spector on the vote:  The US Constitution states that  Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.  We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard for me to see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus. Even with all the evidence that pointed to the danger this bill would  our nation, Hillary voted  Yes  while the majority of the Sentate voted against her.Today, the attorney s who defended GITMO prisoners are rewarding Hillary for her vote with a major fundraiser.Watch: \",\n          \"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The FBI is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Hillary Clinton\\u2019s use of a private email system, it said on Friday, in a new twist that could damage the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential race. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information, adding that he did not know \\u201chow long it will take us to complete this additional work.\\u201d The announcement came as Clinton and Republican opponent Donald Trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  In a news conference late on Friday in Des Moines, Iowa, Clinton urged Comey to release more details about what the FBI was looking for in the newly discovered emails. She leads Trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest. Fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns, and questions around the FBI investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states. U.S. stocks immediately fell sharply on the news, but went on to partially recover. The FBI spent about a year investigating Clinton\\u2019s use of the unauthorized server at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while she was U.S. secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails.  Comey said in July that while \\u201cthere is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\\u201d Although Comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against Clinton, Trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office. He seized on Friday\\u2019s development at rallies in Maine and New Hampshire. \\u201cThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I\\u2019m sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,\\u201d Trump told a crowd in Lisbon, Maine. \\u201cWe hope that all, all justice will be fully served,\\u201d he said. Supporters cheered his words and chanted, \\u201cLock her up.\\u201d Clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports.  \\u201cI\\u2019m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why it\\u2019s incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what\\u2019s going on.\\u201d Two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into Clinton, but rather as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. The FBI has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, and found the Clinton emails on a device related to that investigation, the sources said. Abedin told federal investigators in April that she used several email accounts for her work, including a Yahoo email, according to a summary of the interview released by the FBI in September. She said it was difficult to print from the State Department\\u2019s email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out, according to the summary.  Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the U.S. Congress. Lawyers representing Abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on Friday. Weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, and he did not respond to phone calls. Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who had previously advised former President Bill Clinton but has no role with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s campaign, said the linking of Clinton\\u2019s email woes with Weiner\\u2019s sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from Trump\\u2019s sex scandals. \\u201cThe whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption and scandal,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNobody remembers the beginning of something, they only remember the end. What are they going to remember? They\\u2019re all the same: sex, scandal, corruption, emails. People are going to have trouble sorting out all this information.\\u201d Clinton\\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said it was \\u201cextraordinary\\u201d for the FBI to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election. \\u201cThe Director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining,\\u201d Podesta said in a statement. \\u201cWe are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July.\\u201d  Clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. She has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information. While the FBI probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to Clinton in the coming days, it was unclear what impact it would have when Americans go to the polls. Election experts say about 20 percent of ballots have already been cast, as more Americans vote by mail or go to the polls early. \\u201cA lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake I think,\\u201d said Linda Fowler, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \\u201cThey know she did it, they know it was inappropriate and, failing some sensational revelation on Nov. 6, it\\u2019s hard to see that it\\u2019s going to make that big a difference.\\u201d Still, Republican lawmakers, who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, leaped to condemn Clinton. House Speaker Paul Ryan reiterated his call that the Democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over. Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, said the FBI\\u2019s decision to look into the emails shows \\u201chow serious this discovery must be.\\u201d    Clinton did not respond to reporters\\u2019 shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. U.S. stocks declined in a volatile session on Friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the FBI announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the day down about 9 points, or .05 percent, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged on the day. The dollar also fell against major currencies. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"true\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

russian lawyer, two sources told reuters on thursday, signaling an investigation is gathering pace into suspected russian meddling in the 2016 u.s. election. the sources added that u.s. special counsel robert mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in washington to help examine allegations of russian interference in the vote. one of the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks. russia has loomed large over the first six months of the trump presidency. u.s. intelligence agencies have concluded that russia worked to tilt the presidential election in trump\\u2019s favor. mueller, who was appointed special counsel in may, is leading the probe, which also examines potential collusion by the trump campaign with russia. moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts.   at a rally in huntington, west virginia, on thursday night, trump said: \\u201cmost people know there were no russians in our campaign. ... we didn\\u2019t win because of russia. we won because of you.\\u201d mueller\\u2019s use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence, including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify. the wall street journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled.  a spokesman for mueller declined comment. a grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who, working behind closed doors, considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought. \\u201cthis is a serious development in the mueller investigation,\\u201d said paul callan, a former prosecutor.  \\u201cgiven that mueller inherited an investigation that began months ago, it would suggest that he has uncovered information pointing in the direction of criminal charges. but against whom is the real question.\\u201d  a lawyer for trump, jay sekulow, appeared to downplay the significance of a grand jury, telling fox news: \\u201cthis is not an unusual move.\\u201d u.s. stocks and the dollar weakened following the news, while u.s. treasury securities gained. it was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate.  some lawyers said it would put pressure on potential witnesses to cooperate with mueller\\u2019s investigation.  \\u201cwhen someone gets a subpoena to testify, that can drive home the seriousness of the investigation,\\u201d said david sklansky, a professor at stanford law school and a former federal prosecutor.  in 2005, a grand jury convened by special counsel patrick fitzgerald returned an indictment of lewis \\u201cscooter\\u201d libby, a top aide to then-vice president dick cheney. \\u201ca special counsel can bring an indictment and it has happened before,\\u201d said renato mariotti, a partner at the law firm thompson coburn and a former federal prosecutor. news last month of the meeting between donald trump jr. and a russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about his father\\u2019s presidential rival, democrat hillary clinton, fueled questions about the campaign\\u2019s dealings with moscow.  the republican president has defended his son\\u2019s behavior, saying many people would have taken that meeting. trump\\u2019s son-in-law and white house senior adviser jared kushner and former trump campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting. one of the sources said major russian efforts to interfere in the election on trump\\u2019s behalf began shortly after the june meeting, making it a focus of mueller\\u2019s investigation. ty cobb, special counsel to the president, said he was not aware that mueller had started using a new grand jury. \\u201cgrand jury matters are typically secret,\\u201d cobb said. \\u201cthe white house favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... the white house is committed to fully cooperating with mr. mueller.\\u201d john dowd, one of trump\\u2019s personal lawyers, said: \\u201cwith respect to the news of the grand jury, i can tell you president trump is not under investigation.\\u201d a spokesman for manafort declined to comment.  lawyers for trump jr. and kushner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. trump has questioned mueller\\u2019s impartiality and members of congress from both parties have expressed concern that trump might dismiss him. republican and democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on thursday seeking to block trump from firing mueller.  sekulow denied that was trump\\u2019s plan. \\u201cthe president is not thinking of firing bob mueller,\\u201d sekulow said. one source briefed on the matter said mueller was investigating whether, either at the meeting or afterward, anyone affiliated with the trump campaign encouraged the russians to start releasing material they had been collecting on the clinton campaign since march 2016. another source familiar with the inquiry said that while the president himself was not now under investigation, mueller\\u2019s investigation was seeking to determine whether he knew of the june 9 meeting in advance or was briefed on it afterward. reuters earlier reported that mueller\\u2019s team was examining money-laundering accusations against manafort and hoped to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between trump\\u2019s campaign and russia. it is not known if the grand jury is investigating those potential charges. \",\n          \"sarah sanders announced

white south african farmers who were filmed pushed a wailing black man into a coffin were sentenced to jail on friday for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping. the 20-second video, widely circulated on social media last year, shows the victim, victor mlotshwa, cowering inside a coffin as one man pushes the lid down and the other threatens to put petrol and a snake inside. the defendants - theo jackson, sentenced to 14 years, and willem oosthuizen, sentenced to 11 years - had pleaded not guilty. they said they had caught mlotshwa trespassing on their farm in possession of stolen copper cables. the case, heard at a court in middelburg, about 160 km (100 miles) east of the capital, pretoria, has caused outrage in a country where deep racial divides persist 23 years after the end of apartheid. when she handed down the sentences, judge segopotje mphahlele said she was appalled that the accused had put mlotshwa into a coffin.  the evidence before court indicates that the seriousness of the offence far outweighs the mitigating factors and the personal factors of the offenders,  she said.  the conduct of the accused fueled social division and racial tension.      the defense immediately requested that it be allowed to appeal the sentence, but mphahlele dismissed their application. the defense then said it would lodge their appeal directly to the supreme court of appeal, saying that the sentence was too harsh, since no one had been killed. south africa s justice minister michael masutha said the sentence could serve as a deterrent to others.  south africa is no longer prepared to treat racism with kid gloves and we are ready to act,  justice minister michael masutha said in an interview with enca. a large crowd formed outside the packed courtroom. the police presence around the court was heavy.  what they did was painful to us,  qgoga mnyamezeli said outside the court. hundreds of members of the country s main political parties, including the ruling african national congress and the main opposition democratic alliance party, gathered outside carrying placards, some which said  black lives matter! , and shouting slogans in support of mlotshwa. black people make up 80 percent of south africa s 54 million population, but most its wealth remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent of the population. \"\n
